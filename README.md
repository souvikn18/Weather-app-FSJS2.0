# Weather-app-FSJS2.0

## Live Preview: https://weather-app-souvik-nath.netlify.app/

This is a real time weather app. HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript are used to create this app. This is a desktop and mobile device responsive page. The complete design and develpoment is done by me. I used Weather API for the datas to be fetched.

Here are the code files:

[HTML](./index.html)

[CSS](./style.css)

[JS](./script.js)

***All the other details are disabled because I didn't have the paid version of weather api and the trial period got over***
